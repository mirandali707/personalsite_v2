    <article class="markdown-body"><p>My most fluent medium is mechanical pencil (specifically a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Twist-Erase-Automatic-Assorted-QE517BP2-K6/dp/B002JG10GG">Pentel Twist-Erase III</a>), and I&#39;m too attached to the tactile sensations of making physical art to truly enjoy making digital art, but I wanted to see how I could use digital means (and open-source code!) to augment/enhance my physical art.</p>
<p>A while ago, I did this study of a painting of Mary Magdalene in my sketchbook:
<img src="img/art/magdalene.png" alt="A pencil sketch of Mary Magdalene, a woman with wavy hair, holding a cross and looking upwards while reclining on a rock."></p>
<p>I then scanned the sketch, imported it into Procreate, and made a 12fps animation:</p>

<p>Then I used <a href="https://github.com/hzwer/arXiv2020-RIFE">RIFE: Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation for Video Frame Interpolation</a> to augment framerate, to 48fps:</p>

<p>This was a fun experiment, and helped me realize that I don&#39;t need to eschew my attachment to the physical realm in order to make cool digital art. :^)</p>
