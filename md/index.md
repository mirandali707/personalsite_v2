# Miranda Li
I'm a student at Stanford studying computer science. I spend most of my time thinking about art, journalism, education, accessibility and (sometimes/frequently) their intersections with technology & computation.

My email is mirandal at stanford dot edu; my resume is [here](./assets/Miranda_Li_Resume.pdf); my Linkedin is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miranda-li-b83859124/).
