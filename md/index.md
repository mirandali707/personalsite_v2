# Miranda Li
I'm a student at Stanford studying computer science. I spend most of my time thinking about art, journalism, education, accessibility and (sometimes/frequently) their intersections with technology & computation.

* Recently I've
  - authored accessible assignments for 12,000+ students and curriculum for teaching 900+ volunteer teachers as part of the [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) head TA team
    - currently I'm working on a mass storytelling project related to Code in Place with the support of Stanford Engineering and the Stanford Oral History Project, and I'm also actively involved in thinking about the future of decentralized CS education (the next iteration of Code in Place!)
  - produced AI-generated poetry for an upcoming exhibition by [Rashaad Newsome](https://rashaadnewsome.com/)
  - helped with the upcoming redesign of [Artbreeder](https://www.artbreeder.com/)
  - built a voice conversion pipeline for anonymization / protection of subjects in documentary films with [Teus Media](https://www.teus.media/)
  - generated fake newspaper scans and made a real zine for a project called [Nonsense Newspapers](https://mirandali707.github.io/nonsense_newspapers/)
