My most fluent medium is mechanical pencil (specifically a [Pentel Twist-Erase III](https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Twist-Erase-Automatic-Assorted-QE517BP2-K6/dp/B002JG10GG)), and I'm too attached to the tactile sensations of making physical art to truly enjoy making digital art, but I wanted to see how I could use digital means (and open-source code!) to augment/enhance my physical art.

A while ago, I did this study of a painting of Mary Magdalene in my sketchbook:
![A pencil sketch of Mary Magdalene, a woman with wavy hair, holding a cross and looking upwards while reclining on a rock.](img/art/magdalene.png)

I then scanned the sketch, imported it into Procreate, and made a 12fps animation:

Then I used [RIFE: Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation for Video Frame Interpolation](https://github.com/hzwer/arXiv2020-RIFE) to augment framerate, to 48fps:

This was a fun experiment, and helped me realize that I don't need to eschew my attachment to the physical realm in order to make cool digital art. :^)
